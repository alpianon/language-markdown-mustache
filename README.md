# language markdown + mustache

Highlight markdown+mustache syntax for mardown mustache files.

This package adds a **new grammar named `source.gfm.mustache`**, used by default for files with extension `*.md.mustache`.

You should **add such grammar in the settings** of other installed Atom packages related to markdown text editing (eg. in spell-check settings, in order to enable spell check also for markdown mustache files; in markdown-enhanced-preview, in order to enable preview of markdown mustache files; etc.)
